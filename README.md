# Aim Trainer

## Description of the Project
This application will be used to train aim and precision. Many online games require good aim and mouse positioning to succeed, and I want to create an aim trainer that will help achieve just that. I believe people who play competitive games that involve some form of precise mouse movement would like to use this application. I am interested in making this project as I have played a lot of games that require mouse precision, however have not found an **effective tool that is also free**. My project will store a user profile that will keep track of their accuracy, improvement, precision, time to travel, and more.
